REXX & ASM archive
==================

When I was 15 years old, I learned programming using IBM PC DOS 7 REXX and assembler language to work with DOS and BIOS functions.

Doing so resulted in a collection of BAT and ASM files, which I still have on my computer here. I just put everything in git, added some comments in the commit messages and used the original preserved file modification times as commit and author date.

It's fun to see back my own thought process and development while just trying out things.

A few of my favourites are:

 * [Yathzee REXX v1.00, learning the language by writing a game.](https://github.com/knorrie/rexx-asm-archive/commit/6d2e75c1e87433948de3b6e4a1d7afc0a59d9b4d)
 * [YATHZEE REXX v2.00 shortly after, which throws away about 75% of the original code by optimizing it.](https://github.com/knorrie/rexx-asm-archive/commit/65860f18e9d25c2212ed3e1ea39f227b2b339c9c)
