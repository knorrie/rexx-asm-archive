               MOV  BP,SP              ;Use BP to address stack

    This example uses something called a structure, which is only available
    in the large assembler; furthermore, it uses it without allocating it,
    which is not a well-documented option.  However, I find the above
    approach generally pleasing.  The STRUC is like a DSECT in that it
    establishes labels as being offset a certain distance from an arbitrary
    point; these labels are then used in the body of code by beginning them
    with a period; the construction ".ARG2" means, basically, " +
    (ARG2-ARGS)."
